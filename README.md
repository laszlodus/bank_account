## 🎓 About This Project

This project was built as part of the [**"The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!"**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) taught by **Jonas Schmedtmann** on Udemy.

While following the course, I was guided through the development of this app, which helped me:
- Understand key JavaScript concepts
- Learn DOM manipulation
- Practice event-driven programming
- Work with arrays and objects in depth

Although it was based on a course project, I made sure to deeply understand each part, and now I’m confident I could build a similar application from scratch on my own.
